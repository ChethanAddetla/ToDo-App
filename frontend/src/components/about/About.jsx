          HII extends a range of capabilities across space-based operations,
          from advanced geospatial intelligence, leading-edge AI, autonomous
          cueing of ISR networks space network modeling, simulation and
          analysis. HII also provides special mission support to the U.S. Space
          Force and electronic warfare design, development and
          hardware-in-the-loop capabilities for spacecraft.
